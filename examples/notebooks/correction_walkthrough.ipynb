Drift correction is useful when a series of images is analyzed. Currently, it works by translating an image so that the color checkers overlap between images. Curvature/shape correction corrects for geometrically distorted features in the image by removing curvature (obtaining a 2D representation of the object of interest in the image), and cropping the image.\n",
